# Language understanding

The Course starts with a discussion on how we can agree that our system understands language:

1. Our first attempt is to determine its truth condition, i.e. to state what has to be true in order that the whole statement is true. For example, we say in this sense that we understand the statement "Every Aminoacid contains nitrogen" because we can specify the following condition for that sentence to be true: "everything that refers to the word "aminoacid" belongs to the set of things that have nitorgen in it". This criterion is not the only way we can understand language, because of the subjectivity of some sentences. For instance, the statement "Love is the most important thing in life" has a unclear truth condition, because there are various criterions to specify what order of importance have the things in life.

2. Another way to define the understanding of a statement is from its entailments (implications or concecuences).

3. Another posiblity is to say that we understand a sentences if we can respond appropiatly to it. 

4. Also, we can measure how well we understood something if we can translate it to another language.
